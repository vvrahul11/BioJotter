 BioJotter : A biological notepad
 ============

# Abstract

Biological sequence manipulation using Bioinformatics techniques and tools became a cumbersome task in front of the biological community .The Lack of availability of many important sequence manipulation features on a common platform resulting in the slow analysis of the sequences. BioJotter has been developed to tackle these problems, by an easy to use interface that can handle many tasks of molecular biology in an efficient manner.

BioJotter is a small but intelligent notepad for biological sequence analysis which makes sequence handling an enjoyable and easy task for Bioinformatics and Life Scientists. BioJotter will be a free source code editor and Notepad replacement, which supports several biological programming languages, running under the MS Windows and Linux environment. I hope you enjoy BioJotter as much as we enjoy biological coding and sequence handling.

Pleaese let me know if any problem related with biological computing.


# Overview:

The BioJotter provides several features that makes the sequence manipulation an easier work ,its main advantage is that it is very easy to use. The BioJotter has been developed in Perl/Tk,which provides a graphical user interface. BioJotter has nine pull down menu options that include File,Edit, Format, Window, SeqEx, Format Convert, Online Tools, WWW, and About. The BioJotter has been developed with a special feature by which the color of the text area; six default color options are provided that includes Black, White, Skyblue, Pink, Grey, and Brown. These colors especially black gives less intense light from the screen, which reduces the irritation of the eyes, that give an option you to gaze your lovely sequences :). DNA sequences and Amino acids are provided with default color option which helps to detect the patterns in the sequenc can be changed with desire color. The BioNotepad also allow the user to do rough work of the sequence under manipulation on a separate screen or the user can even do manipulation of a particular region of the sequence on the text area on a different screen at a time. Features like mutater, finder and replacer are also Included in biojotter.

BioJotter can handle big FASTA files very efficiently .It has been tested on all the different versions of Microsoft operating system and found to be effective. BioJotter also allows the user to do BLAST and Genscan directly; the user can give multiple FASTA files in case of BLAST and whole genome of an organism in case of Genscan. The BioJotter will take the input sequence to the respective servers and the result will be created on a separate notepad that the user can specify. This biological notepad has features to analyse the composition and can draw graphs based on that your sequences. BioJotter can also identify ORF regions and can be translated.
